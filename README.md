# Second Hand cars Price Prediction


## Project Overview
The project is a Second Hand Car Price Prediction system that uses machine learning to predict the prices of used cars based on various features such as brand, model, year, kilometers driven, fuel type, transmission, owner type, mileage, engine, power, seats, and price. The project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook and leverages libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

## Objectives
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation
- Price prediction

## Key Features
- Dataset: `cars.csv`
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- Model: Linear Regression

## Conclusion
The project successfully predicts the prices of second-hand cars using machine learning techniques. By preprocessing the data, performing EDA, and training a model, the project provides a robust solution for price prediction. The evaluation metrics indicate the model's accuracy and reliability, making it a valuable tool for potential buyers and sellers in the second-hand car market.
